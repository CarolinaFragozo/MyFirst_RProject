## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| output: false

## Introduction

Type 1 diabetes (T1D), formerly known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disease that originates when cells that make insulin (beta cells) are destroyed by the immune system. The aim of this analysis is to visualize the glucose control in term of a1C in a cohort of participants with T1D at University Hospital in Switzerland.

## Data

We analyzed the data of A1C in a cohort of participants with T1D at University Hospital in Switzerland.

```{r}
#| output: false

# Read data
cases <- read_csv("/Users/PrecisionLab/OneDrive - Universitaet Bern/Documents/RStudio_Project Course/T1DEXI Base de datos Carolina Feb 23 2024.csv")

# Process data 
```

@fig-cases shows the HbA1C data in a cohort of participants with T1D at University Hospital in Switzerland.

```{r}
#| label: fig-cases 
#| fig-cap: "HbA1C data in a cohort of participants with T1D"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

ggplot(cases, aes (x= id, y= a1c)) + 
  geom_bar (stat = "identity", fill = unibeSaphire ())+
  labs(x = "", y = "a1c") + theme_minimal() 
```

# Conclusions

Our Analysis, showed that most of the participant with T1D do not meet the target in term of A1C (less than 6%) according to the diabetes guidelines. We need to move forward beyond insulin therapies to reach the target.
