## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#I  output:false
# Load libraries 
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
library(unibeCols)
library(tidyverse)
```
## Introduction 
The aim of this exercise is to visualise the increase in laboratory-confirmed of COVID-19 in Switzerland in Autuum 2020. 

## Data

We read an process the data of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Switzerland reported by the Federal Office of Public Health. 

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r load data}
#| output: false
# Read data
cases <- read_csv("/Users/PrecisionLab/OneDrive - Universitaet Bern/Documents/RStudio_Project Course/COVID19Cases_geoRegion.csv")
```

```{r set parameters}
# Process data 
region <- "CH"
window_start <- ymd("2020.09.01")
window_end <- ymd("2020.11.30")
cases <- cases |>
  filter(geoRegion == region & datum >= window_start & datum <= window_end) |> select (datum, entries) 
```

@fig-cases shows the number of laboratory-confirmed of COVID-19 in Switzerland from `r window_start` to `window_end`. 

```{r create figure}
#| label: fig-cases 
#| fig-cap: "laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Switzerland in 2020."
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(cases, aes (x= datum, y= entries)) + 
  geom_bar (stat = "identity", fill = unibeSaphire ())+
  labs(x = "", y = "laboratory-confirmed cases") + theme_minimal() 
```
# Conclusions

the numbers of laboratory-confirmed of COVID-19 in Switzerland. 

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
