Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

## Introduction 
Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates. The aim of this analysis is to visualize the worldwide Ebola cumulative-incidence during 2014-2016 epidemic period. 

## Data

We analyzed the data of cumulative-incidence of Ebola reported by "UNICEF". https://www.unicef.de/informieren/aktuelles/blog/-/ebola-fakten-und-lichtblicke/274006


```{r load data}
#| output: false
# Read data
cases <- read_csv("/Users/PrecisionLab/OneDrive - Universitaet Bern/Documents/RStudio_Project Course/ebola.csv")
```

```{r set parameters}
# Process data 
window_start <- ymd("2014.01.01")
window_end <- ymd("2016.12.31")
Cum_conf_cases <- cases |>
  filter(Date >= window_start & Date <= window_end) |> select (Date,Cum_conf_cases) 
```

@fig-cases shows the number of cumulative-cases of Ebola in the worldwide from `r window_start` to `r window_end`. 

```{r create figure}
#| label: fig-cases 
#| fig-cap: "Cumulative-cases of Ebola Epidemic period (2014-2016)."
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(cases, aes (x= Date, y= Cum_conf_cases)) + 
  geom_bar (stat = "identity", fill = unibeSaphire ())+
  labs(x = "", y = "cumulative-cases") + theme_minimal() 
```
# Conclusions

The 2014â€“2016 outbreak of Ebola was the largest since the virus was first discovered in 1976. the number of cumulative-cases of Ebola in the worldwide had a progressive increase since 2014 until the winter of 2016.
